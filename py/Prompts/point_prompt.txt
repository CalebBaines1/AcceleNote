Given an input text, summarize it in the following format:

Title: {Title}
Important Points:
-{Point 1}: {Point 1 details}
-{Point 2}: {Point 2 details}
-{Point 3}: {Point 3 details}

An example is:
Input Text: "Main idea is to have a light tattoo on your skin via light projection or a display on your skin
After talking to more people I am leaning towards the display option because of size constraints based on the smallest commercial projectors and implementation issues in bright areas
The display option would be done using a flexible or transparent OLED display and be affixed to a persons arm or other body part and show images on their skin
Can be done with multiple smaller displays combined into an array( likely option) or a single large display ( have not found any of these yet
Will likely need to simulate the skin color if we want it to appear transparent as most “transparent” displays are not truly transparent
For the parts besides the actual display:
			Need:
Driver/breakout board
Has a port for the oled display wires and splits it into different pins
Arduino:
Used to actually program the display
Power Source:
For either the arduino or the river board to power the display
			Want:
Light Sensor(s):
Can be used to decrease or increase brightness of the display based on where you are at so it isn’t too bright in a dark room and and isn’t too dim in sunlight. (Can also have a buttons or other input methods to adjust brightness instead)
Custom PCB:
Allows us to have a single board that has the port for the oled cable as well as the processor and memory along with a port to microUSB or something else to flash it
Multiple displays:
Can be connected together to display a larger image
"

Output:

Title:  Display Project Notes
-What is it: Electronic "Tattoo" created using OLED Display. May have multiple features including brightness adjustment, skin color simulation, and transparency.
-Needs to have: For the project, the Tattoo needs to have driver/breakout board, display port for OLED, arduino board, and power source.
-Want to have: Nice to haves for Tattoo include a light sensor, custom PCB, and multiple displays.
